              <p>At the start of late of adolescence (18~25) is the peak of life because there's nothing to lose. 
                This period of time is for one to try everything like finding the career path you are passionate of, 
                live a brand new life. Go Crazy! Youth is a very precious gift to shape one's future.
              </p>
              <p>Just like everyone else, striving to find the key that unlocks the safe that traps one's dreams and infinite desires,
                even though the key doesn't really seem to exist. Well, finding the key sounds easy but to do it, one would have to change, 
                not just personality but also mindset, habit, time, lifestyle...

              <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled
                and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
                pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of 
                will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
                In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every 
                pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations 
                of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds 
                in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
